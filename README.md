# **String Calculator**

A simple **String Calculator** that performs addition on comma-separated numbers. It supports custom delimiters, multiple delimiters, and handles edge cases like negative numbers. The calculator is implemented using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles.

---

## **Features**
- Handles a string of comma-separated numbers and returns their sum.
- Supports **custom delimiters**, e.g., `"//;\n1;2"` returns `3`.
- Supports **multiple custom delimiters**, e.g., `"//[*][%]\n1*2%3"` returns `6`.
- Throws an exception for **negative numbers**, e.g., `"1,-2,-3"` throws:  
  `"Negative numbers not allowed: -2, -3"`.
- Supports newlines (`\n`) as delimiters.

## **Usage**
1. Run the tests to ensure everything works as expected:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
2. Use the `add` function by importing it in your Node.js application:
   ```javascript

   console.log(add("1,2,3")); // Outputs: 6
   console.log(add("//;\n1;2")); // Outputs: 3
   console.log(add("//[*][%]\n1*2%3")); // Outputs: 6
   ```
